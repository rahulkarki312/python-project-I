This program shows the difference in using an efficient algorithm over a not-so efficient one.

The binary-search algorithm follows the Divide-and-conquer algorithm, which keeps breaking
 down the array into two equal halves, until the purpose (here, finding a target number in
an array).
Also, another method is used for the same case, but it searches the whole array for that 
target number. This consequently increases time complexity of the program and delays the
output speed.
